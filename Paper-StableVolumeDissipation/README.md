# Stable Volume Dissipation for High-Order Finite-Difference Methods with the Generalized Summation-by-Parts Property

This directory contains all the files necessary to reproduce the plots from the paper titled "Stable Volume Dissipation for High-Order Finite-Difference Methods with the Generalized Summation-by-Parts Property" by Alex Bercik, David A. Craig Penner, and David W. Zingg, published in 2025 (preprint).

## NOTE: We have recently become aware of a bug in our code that caused the numerical results to appear worse than they should in regions of near-zero density. The impacted section is 5.3. We are fixing the problem and will have an updated manuscript posted to arXiv soon.

## Contents

- Source code for generating the plots
- Data files used in the paper for the 2D Euler Vortex Problem
- Supplementary Material PDF

## Paper

The preprint of the paper can be found on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12670

## Debugging
Install instructions can be found in the main directory for ESSBP.
If you have issues running this code, feel free to contact Alex Bercik directly.
Last verified to run properly at commit 7fc07251508759ebbb726d35e3bebd2f2ccc4453
