	abstract = {A systematic approach based on a diagonal-norm, summation-by-parts (SBP) framework is presented for implementing entropy stable (SS) formulations of any order for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). These SS formulations discretely conserve mass, momentum, energy and satisfy a mathematical entropy equality for smooth problems. They are also valid for discontinuous flows provided sufﬁcient dissipation is added at shocks and discontinuities to satisfy an entropy inequality. Admissible SBP operators include all centered diagonal-norm ﬁnite-difference (FD) operators, and Legendre spectral collocation, ﬁnite-element methods (LSC-FEM). Entropy stable multiblock FD and FEM operators follows immediately via nonlinear coupling operators that ensure conservation, accuracy and preserve the interior entropy estimates. Nonlinearly stable solid wall boundary conditions are also available. Existing SBP operators that lack a stability proof [e.g., weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)], may be combined with an entropy stable operator using a comparison technique to guarantee nonlinear stability of the pair. All capabilities extend naturally to a curvilinear form of the NSE provided that the coordinate mappings satisfy a geometricconservation-law (GCL) constraint. Examples are presented that demonstrate the robustness of current state-of-the-art entropy stable SBP formulations.},

In particular, we consider general multidimensional SBP elements, building on and generalizing previous work with tensor-product discretizations. In the absence of dissipation, we prove that the semi-discrete scheme conserves entropy; signiﬁcantly, this proof of nonlinear L2 stability does not rely on integral exactness. Furthermore, interior penalties can be incorporated into the discretization to ensure that the total (mathematical) entropy decreases monotonically, producing an entropy-stable scheme. SBP discretizations with curved elements remain accurate, conservative, and entropy stable provided the mapping Jacobian satisﬁes the discrete metric invariants; polynomial mappings at most one degree higher than the SBP operators automatically satisfy the metric invariants in two dimensions. In three-dimensions, we describe an elementwise optimization that leads to suitable Jacobians in the case of polynomial mappings. The properties of the semi-discrete scheme are veriﬁed and investigated using numerical experiments.},

	abstract = {This work examines the development of an entropy conservative (for smooth solutions) or entropy stable (for discontinuous solutions) space–time discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The resulting numerical scheme is fully discrete and provides a bound on the mathematical entropy at any time according to its initial condition and boundary conditions. The crux of the method is that discrete derivative approximations in space and time are summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. This allows the discrete method to mimic results from the continuous entropy analysis and ensures that the complete numerical scheme obeys the second law of thermodynamics. Importantly, the novel method described herein does not assume any exactness of quadrature in the variational forms that naturally arise in the context of DG methods. Typically, the development of entropy stable schemes is done on the semidiscrete level ignoring the temporal dependence. In this work, we demonstrate that creating an entropy stable DG method in time is similar to the spatial discrete entropy analysis, but there are important (and subtle) differences. Therefore, we highlight the temporal entropy analysis throughout this work. For the compressible Euler equations, the preservation of kinetic energy is of interest besides entropy stability. The construction of kinetic energy preserving (KEP) schemes is, again, typically done on the semidiscrete level similar to the construction of entropy stable schemes. We present a generalization of the KEP condition from Jameson to the space–time framework and provide the temporal components for both entropy stability and kinetic energy preservation. The properties of the space–time DG method derived herein are validated through numerical tests for the compressible Euler equations. Additionally, we provide, in appendices, how to construct the temporal entropy stable components for the shallow water or ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations.},

	abstract = {Summation-by-parts (SBP) operators have a number of properties that make them an attractive option for higher-order spatial discretizations of partial differential equations. In particular, they enable the derivation of higher-order boundary closures leading to provable time stability. When implemented on multi-block structured meshes in conjunction with simultaneous approximation terms (SATs) — penalty terms that impose boundary and interblock-coupling conditions in a weak sense — they offer additional properties of value, even for second-order accurate schemes and steady problems. For example, they involve low communication overhead for efﬁcient parallel algorithms and relax the continuity requirements of both the mesh and the solution across block interfaces. This paper provides a brief history of seminal contributions to, and applications of, SBP-SAT methods followed by a description of their properties and a methodology for deriving SBP operators for ﬁrst derivatives and second derivatives with variable coefﬁcients. A procedure for deriving SATs is also provided. Practical aspects are discussed, including artiﬁcial dissipation, transformation to curvilinear coordinates, and application to the Navier-Stokes equations. Recent developments are reviewed, including a variational interpretation, the connection to quadrature rules, functional superconvergence, error estimates, and dual consistency. Finally, the connection to quadrature rules is exploited to provide a generalization of the SBP concept to a broader class of operators, enabling a uniﬁcation and rigorous development of SATs for operators such as nodal-based pseudo-spectral and some discontinuous Galerkin operators.},

	title = {Efficient algorithms for future aircraft design: contributions to aerodynamic shape optimization},
	abstract = {Advances in numerical optimization have raised the possibility that efficient and novel aircraft configurations may be “discovered” by an algorithm. To begin exploring this possibility, a fast and robust set of tools for aerodynamic shape optimization is developed. Parameterization and mesh-movement are integrated to accommodate large changes in the geometry. This integrated approach uses a coarse B-spline control grid to represent the geometry and move the computational mesh; consequently, the mesh-movement algorithm is two to three orders faster than a node-based linear elasticity approach, without compromising mesh quality. Aerodynamic analysis is performed using a flow solver for the Euler equations. The governing equations are discretized using summation-by-parts finite-difference operators and simultaneous approximation terms, which permit C0 mesh continuity at block interfaces. The discretization results in a set of nonlinear algebraic equations, which are solved using an efficient parallel Newton-Krylov-Schur strategy. A gradient-based optimization algorithm is adopted. The gradient is evaluated using adjoint variables for the flow and mesh equations in a sequential approach. The flow adjoint equations are solved using a novel variant of the Krylov solver GCROT. This variant of GCROT is flexible to take advantage of non-stationary preconditioners and is shown to outperform restarted flexible GMRES. The aerodynamic optimizer is applied to several studies of induced-drag minimization. An elliptical lift distribution is recovered by varying spanwise twist, thereby validating the algorithm. Planform optimization based on the Euler equations produces a nonelliptical lift distribution, in contrast with the predictions of lifting-line theory. A study of spanwise vertical shape optimization confirms that a winglet-up configuration is more efficient than a winglet-down configuration. A split-tip geometry is used to explore nonlinear wake-wing interactions: the optimized split-tip demonstrates a significant reduction in induced drag relative to a single-tip wing. Finally, the optimal spanwise loading for a box-wing configuration is investigated.},

The optimization of free parameters in the operators is investigated to minimize solution errors of test cases. The results show that increasing the degree of the cubature rule from pcub = 2p − 1 to pcub = 2p, where p is the degree of the operator, reduces the solution error, but that there is no benefit to increasing pcub any further. Progress is also presented in understanding how unisolvent sets of nodes can be constructed, which is important for certain families of SBP operators. Finally, novel operators are constructed that provide lower solution errors than existing operators for the same computational cost. For example, a novel p = 2 operator in the diagonal-E family is derived with a solution error 44\% to 68\% lower for the same computational cost and with 10 fewer nodes than the best previously published operator of that family and degree.},

Compared to the classic DG method which is only provably stable for the square entropy, these DG forms can be tailored to satisfy an arbitrary given entropy inequality, and do not require exact integration. The methodology is within the summation-by-parts (SBP) paradigm, such that the discrete operators collocated at the quadrature points should satisfy the SBP property. The construction is relatively easy for quadrature rules with collocated surface nodes. We use the flux differencing technique to en- sure entropy balance within elements, and the simultaneous approximation terms (SATs) to produce entropy dissipation on element interfaces. The further extension to general quadra- ture rules is achieved through careful modifications of SATs.},

	abstract = {High order (HO) schemes are attractive candidates for the numerical solution of multiscale problems occurring in fluid dynamics and related disciplines. Among the HO discretization variants, discontinuous Galerkin schemes oﬀer a collection of advantageous features which have lead to a strong increase in interest in them and related formulations in the last decade. The methods have matured suﬃciently to be of practical use for a range of problems, for example in direct numerical and large eddy simulation of turbulence. However, in order to take full advantage of the potential beneﬁts of these methods, all steps in the simulation chain must be designed and executed with HO in mind. Especially in this area, many commercially available closed-source solutions fall short. In this work, we therefor present the FLEXI framework, a HO consistent, open-source simulation tool chain for solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in a high performance computing setting. We describe the numerical algorithms and implementation details and give an overview of the features and capabilities of all parts of the framework. Beyond these technical details, we also discuss the important, but often overlooked issues of code stability, reproducibility and user-friendliness. The beneﬁts gained by developing an open-source framework are discussed, with a particular focus on usability for the open-source community. We close with sample applications that demonstrate the wide range of use cases and the expandability of FLEXI and an overview of current and future developments.},

The accuracy of the weight matrix as a quadrature rule is not explicitly part of the SBP deﬁnition. We show that SBP weight matrices are related to trapezoid rules with end corrections whose accuracy matches the corresponding diﬀerence operator at internal nodes. The accuracy of SBP quadrature extends to curvilinear domains provided the Jacobian is approximated with the same SBP operator used for the quadrature. This quadrature has signiﬁcant implications for SBP-based discretizations; for example, the discrete norm accurately approximates the L2 norm for functions, and multi-dimensional SBP discretizations accurately mimic the divergence theorem.},

	abstract = {It is well known that semi-discrete high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods satisfy cell entropy inequalities for the square entropy for both scalar conservation laws (Jiang and Shu (1994) [39]) and symmetric hyperbolic systems (Hou and Liu (2007) [36]), in any space dimension and for any triangulations. However, this property holds only for the square entropy and the integrations in the DG methods must be exact. It is signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult to design DG methods to satisfy entropy inequalities for a non-square convex entropy, and/or when the integration is approximated by a numerical quadrature. In this paper, we develop a uniﬁed framework for designing high order DG methods which will satisfy entropy inequalities for any given single convex entropy, through suitable numerical quadrature which is speciﬁc to this given entropy. Our framework applies from one-dimensional scalar cases all the way to multi-dimensional systems of conservation laws. For the one-dimensional case, our numerical quadrature is based on the methodology established in Carpenter et al. (2014) [5] and Gassner (2013) [19]. The main ingredients are summation-by-parts (SBP) operators derived from Legendre Gauss–Lobatto quadrature, the entropy conservative ﬂux within elements, and the entropy stable ﬂux at element interfaces. We then generalize the scheme to two-dimensional triangular meshes by constructing SBP operators on triangles based on a special quadrature rule. A local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) type treatment is also incorporated to achieve the generalization to convection–diffusion equations. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate the accuracy and shock capturing eﬃcacy of these entropy stable DG methods.},

Necessary and suﬃcient conditions are proven for the existence of nodal approximations to the ﬁrst derivative with the SBP property. It is proven that the positivedeﬁnite norm matrix of each SBP operator must be associated with a quadrature rule; moreover, given a quadrature rule there exists a corresponding SBP operator, where for diagonal-norm SBP operators the weights of the quadrature rule must be positive. The generalized framework gives a straightforward means of posing many known approximations to the ﬁrst derivative as SBP operators; several are surveyed, such as discontinuous Galerkin discretizations based on the Legendre-Gauss quadrature points, and shown to be SBP operators. Moreover, the new framework provides a method for constructing SBP operators by starting from quadrature rules; this is illustrated by constructing novel SBP operators from known quadrature rules. To demonstrate the utility of the generalization, the Legendre-Gauss and Legendre-GaussRadau quadrature points are used to construct SBP operators that do not include one or both boundary nodes.},

The boundary closure limits the solution to (s + 1)-order global accuracy. Despite this bound on solution accuracy, we show that functional estimates can be constructed that are 2s-order accurate. This superconvergence requires dual-consistency, which depends on the SBP operators, the boundary condition implementation, and the discretized functional. The theory is developed for scalar hyperbolic and elliptic partial diﬀerential equations in one dimension. In higher dimensions, we show that superconvergent functional estimates remain viable in the presence of curvilinear multiblock grids with interfaces. The generality of the theoretical results is demonstrated using a two-dimensional Poisson problem and a nonlinear hyperbolic system—the Euler equations of ﬂuid mechanics.},

We employ a comparison principle as the main tool for entropy stability analysis, comparing the entropy production of a given scheme against properly chosen
              entropy-conservative
              schemes.
            
            
              To this end, we introduce general families of entropy-conservative schemes, interesting in their own right. The present treatment of such schemes extends our earlier recipe for construction of entropy-conservative schemes, introduced in Tadmor (1987
              b
              ). The new families of entropy-conservative schemes offer two main advantages, namely, (i) their numerical fluxes admit an explicit, closed-form expression, and (ii) by a proper choice of their path of integration in phase space, we can distinguish between different families of waves within the same computational cell; in particular, entropy stability can be enforced on rarefactions while keeping the sharp resolution of shock discontinuities.
            
            A comparison with the numerical viscosities associated with entropy-conservative schemes provides a useful framework for the construction and analysis of entropy-stable schemes. We employ this framework for a detailed study of entropy stability for a host of first- and second-order accurate schemes. The comparison approach yields a precise characterization of the entropy stability of semi-discrete schemes for both scalar problems and systems of equations.
            
              We extend these results to fully discrete schemes. Here, spatial entropy dissipation is balanced by the entropy production due to time discretization with a suffciently small time-step, satisfying a suitable CFL condition. Finally, we revisit the question of entropy stability for fully discrete schemes using a different approach based on
              homotopy
              arguments. We prove entropy stability under optimal CFL conditions.},

A simple and ﬂexible coupling procedure with planar interpolation operators between adjoining nonconforming elements is used. Curvilinear volume metric terms are numerically approximated via a minimization procedure and satisfy the discrete geometric conservation law conditions. Distinct curvilinear surface metrics are used on the adjoining interfaces to construct the interface coupling terms, thereby localizing the discrete geometric conservation law constraints to each individual element. The resulting scheme is entropy conservative/stable, element-wise conservative, and freestream preserving. Viscous interface dissipation operators are developed that retain the entropy stability of the base scheme. The accuracy and stability properties of the resulting numerical scheme are shown to be comparable to those of the original conforming scheme (achieving ⇠ p + 1 convergence) in the context of the viscous shock problem, the Taylor–Green vortex problem at a Reynolds number of Re = 1, 600, and a subsonic turbulent ﬂow past a sphere at Re = 2, 000.},

	abstract = {By using non-equispaced grid points near boundaries, we derive boundary optimized ﬁrst derivative ﬁnite difference operators, of orders up to twelve. The boundary closures are based on a diagonal-norm summation-by-parts (SBP) framework, thereby guaranteeing linear stability on piecewise curvilinear multi-block grids. The new operators lead to signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient numerical approximations, compared with traditional SBP operators on equidistant grids. We also show that the non-uniform grids make it possible to derive operators with fewer one-sided boundary stencils than their traditional counterparts. Numerical experiments with the 2D compressible Euler equations on a curvilinear multi-block grid demonstrate the accuracy and stability properties of the new operators.},

	abstract = {When using a ﬁnite difference method to solve a time dependent partial differential equation, the truncation error is often larger at a few grid points near a boundary or grid interface than in the interior. In computations, the observed convergence rate is often higher than the order of the large truncation error. In this paper, we develop techniques for analyzing this phenomenon, and particularly consider the second order wave equation. The equation is discretized by a ﬁnite difference operator satisfying a summation by parts property, and the boundary and grid interface conditions are imposed weakly by the simultaneous approximation term method. It is well-known that if the semi-discretized wave equation satisﬁes the determinant condition, that is the boundary system in Laplace space is nonsingular for all Re(s) ≥ 0, two orders are gained from the large truncation error localized at a few grid points. By performing a normal mode analysis, we show that many common discretizations do not satisfy the determinant condition at s = 0. We then carefully analyze the error equation to determine the gain in the convergence rate. The result shows that stability does not automatically imply a gain of two orders in the convergence rate. The precise gain can be lower than, equal to or higher than two orders, depending on the boundary condition and numerical boundary treatment. The accuracy analysis is veriﬁed by numerical experiments, and very good agreement is obtained.},

We show that a low-order approximation exhibits unacceptable numerical discretization errors, whereas a naive application of high-order discretizations in those situations is often unstable due to aliasing. Thus, for high-order simulations of underresolved turbulence, proper stabilization is necessary for a successful computation. Two different mechanisms are chosen, and their impact on the accuracy of underresolved high-order computations of turbulent ﬂows is investigated. Results of these approximations for the Taylor–Green Vortex problem are compared to direct numerical simulation results from literature. Our ﬁndings show that the superior discretization properties of high-order approximations are retained even for these coarsely resolved computations.},

	abstract = {Summation-by-parts (SBP) ﬁnite-diﬀerence discretizations share many attractive properties with Galerkin ﬁnite-element methods (FEMs), including time stability and superconvergent functionals; however, unlike FEMs, SBP operators are not completely determined by a basis, so the potential exists to tailor SBP operators to meet diﬀerent objectives. To date, application of highorder SBP discretizations to multiple dimensions has been limited to tensor product domains. This paper presents a deﬁnition for multidimensional SBP ﬁnite-diﬀerence operators that is a natural extension of one-dimensional SBP operators. Theoretical implications of the deﬁnition are investigated for the special case of a diagonal-norm (mass) matrix. In particular, a diagonal-norm SBP operator exists on a given domain if and only if there is a cubature rule with positive weights on that domain and the polynomial-basis matrix has full rank when evaluated at the cubature nodes. Appropriate simultaneous-approximation terms are developed to impose boundary conditions weakly, and the resulting discretizations are shown to be time stable. Concrete examples of multidimensional SBP operators are constructed for the triangle and tetrahedron; similarities and diﬀerences between these SBP operators and those typically used in spectral-element, spectral-diﬀerence, and nodal discontinuous Galerkin methods are discussed. An assembly process is described that builds SBP operators on a global domain from element-level operators. Numerical results of linear advection on a doubly periodic domain demonstrate the accuracy and time stability of the simplex operators.},

	abstract = {We present a novel technique for the imposition of non-linear entropy conservative and entropy stable solid wall boundary conditions for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations in the presence of an adiabatic wall, or a wall with a prescribed heat entropy ﬂow. The procedure relies on the formalism and mimetic properties of diagonal-norm, summationby-parts and simultaneous-approximation-term operators, and is a generalization of previous works on discontinuous interface coupling [1] and solid wall boundary conditions [2]. Using the method of lines, a semi-discrete entropy estimate for the entire domain is obtained when the proposed numerical imposition of boundary conditions are coupled with an entropy-conservative or entropy-stable discrete interior operator. The resulting estimate mimics the global entropy estimate obtained at the continuous level. The boundary data at the wall are weakly imposed using a penalty ﬂux approach and a simultaneous-approximation-term technique for both the conservative variables and the gradient of the entropy variables. Discontinuous spectral collocation operators (mass lumped nodal discontinuous Galerkin operators), on high-order unstructured grids, are used for the purpose of demonstrating the robustness and eﬃcacy of the new procedure for weakly enforcing boundary conditions. Numerical simulations conﬁrm the non-linear stability of the proposed technique, with applications to three-dimensional subsonic and supersonic ﬂows. The procedure described is compatible with any diagonal-norm summation-by-parts spatial operator, including ﬁnite element, ﬁnite difference, ﬁnite volume, discontinuous Galerkin, and ﬂux reconstruction schemes.},

I show how strong hyperbolicity guarantees well-posedness of the initial value problem. Symmetric hyperbolic systems are shown to render the initial boundary value problem well-posed with maximally dissipative boundary conditions. I discuss the Laplace-Fourier method for analyzing the initial boundary value problem. Finally I state how these notions extend to systems that are first order in time and second order in space. In the second lecture I discuss the effect that the gauge freedom of electromagnetism has on the PDE status of the initial value problem. I focus on gauge choices, strong-hyperbolicity and the construction of constraint preserving boundary conditions. I show that strongly hyperbolic pure gauges can be used to build strongly hyperbolic formulations. I examine which of these formulations is additionally symmetric hyperbolic and finally demonstrate that the system can be made boundary stable.},

(2000) is revisited. The entropy splitting is a form of skew-symmetric splitting of the nonlinear Euler ﬂux derivatives. Central diﬀerencing applied to the entropy splitting form of the Euler ﬂux derivatives together with SBP diﬀerence operators will, hereafter, be referred to as entropy split schemes. This study is prompted by the recent growing interest in numerical methods for which a discrete entropy conservation law holds, a discrete global entropy conservation can be proved and/or the numerical method possesses a stable entropy in the framework of SBP diﬀerence operators and L2-energy norm estimate. The objective of this paper is to recast the entropy split scheme as the recent deﬁnition of an entropy stable method for central diﬀerencing with SBP operators for both periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions for nonlinear Euler equations. Standard high order spatial central diﬀerencing as well as high order central spatial DRP (dispersion relation preserving) spatial diﬀerencing is part of the entropy stable methodology framework. Long time integration of 2D and 3D test cases is included to show the comparison of this eﬃcient entropy stable method with the Tadmor-type of entropy conservative methods. Studies also include the comparison among the three skew-symmetric splittings on their nonlinear stability and accuracy performance without added numerical dissipations for smooth ﬂows. These are, namely, entropy splitting, Ducros et al. splitting and the Kennedy \& Grubber splitting.},

To remove the defective high wave number information from the solution, artiﬁcial dissipation operators or ﬁlter operators may be applied. Since stability is our main concern, we are interested in schemes on summation-by-parts (SBP) form with weak imposition of boundary conditions. Artiﬁcial dissipation operators preserving the accuracy and energy stability of SBP schemes are available. However, for ﬁltering procedures it was recently shown that stability problems may occur, even for originally energy stable (in the absence of ﬁltering) SBP based schemes. More precisely, it was shown that even the sharpest possible energy bound becomes very weak as the number of ﬁltrations grow. This suggest that successful ﬁltering include a delicate balance between the need to remove high frequency oscillations (ﬁlter often) and the need to avoid possible growth (ﬁlter seldom). We will discuss this problem and propose a remedy.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11596},
	abstract = {A time discretization method is called strongly stable, if the norm of its numerical solution is nonincreasing. It is known that, even for linear semi-negative problems, many explicit Runge–Kutta (RK) methods fail to preserve this property. In this paper, we enforce strong stability by modifying the method with superviscosity, which is a numerical technique commonly used in spectral methods. We propose two approaches, the modiﬁed method and the ﬁltering method for stabilization. The modiﬁed method is achieved by modifying the semi-negative operator with a high order superviscosity term; the ﬁltering method is to post-process the solution by solving a diﬀusive or dispersive problem with small superviscosity. For linear problems, most explicit RK methods can be stabilized with either approach without accuracy degeneration. Furthermore, we prove a sharp bound (up to an equal sign) on diﬀusive superviscosity for ensuring strong stability. The bound we derived for general dispersive-diﬀusive superviscosity is also veriﬁed to be sharp numerically. For nonlinear problems, a ﬁltering method is investigated for stabilization. Numerical examples with linear non-normal ordinary diﬀerential equation systems and for discontinuous Galerkin approximation of conservation laws are performed to validate our analysis and to test the performance.},

(2019) for the compressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations on nonconforming p-reﬁned/coarsened curvilinear grids to h/ p reﬁnement/coarsening. The main difﬁculty in developing nonconforming algorithms is the construction of appropriate coupling procedures across nonconforming interfaces. Here, we utilize a computationally simple and efﬁcient approach based upon using decoupled interpolation operators. The resulting scheme is entropy conservative/stable and element-wise conservative. Numerical simulations of the isentropic vortex and viscous shock propagation conﬁrm the entropy conservation/stability and accuracy properties of the method (achieving ∼ p + 1 convergence), which are comparable to those of the original conforming scheme (Carpenter et al. in SIAM J Sci Comput 36(5):B835–B867, 2014; Parsani et al. in SIAM J Sci Comput 38(5):A3129–A3162, 2016). Simulations of the Taylor–Green vortex at Re = 1600 and turbulent ﬂow past a sphere at Re∞ = 2000 show the robustness and stability properties of the overall spatial discretization for unstructured grids. Finally, to demonstrate the entropy conservation property of a fully-discrete explicit entropy stable algorithm with h/ p reﬁnement/coarsening, we present the time evolution of the entropy function obtained by simulating the propagation of the isentropic vortex using a relaxation Runge–Kutta scheme.},

Since one interesting example is given by the systems endowed by an entropy, we provide one explicit solution, and show that the accuracy of the new scheme is at most degraded by one order. In the case of a discontinuous Galerkin scheme and a Residual distribution scheme, we show how not to degrade the accuracy. This improves the recent results obtained in [1–4] in the sense that no particular constraints are set on quadrature formula and that a priori maximum accuracy can still be achieved.

	abstract = {The focus of the present research is on the analysis of local linear stability of high-order (including split-form) summation-by-parts methods, with e.g. two-point entropy-conserving ﬂuxes, approximating non-linear conservation laws. Our main ﬁnding is that local linear stability is not guaranteed even when the scheme is non-linearly stable and that this has grave implications for simulation results. We show that entropy-conserving two-point ﬂuxes are inherently locally linearly unstable, as they can be dissipative or anti-dissipative. Unfortunately, these ﬂuxes are at the core of many commonly used high-order entropy-stable extensions, including split-form summation-by-parts discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods (or spectral collocation methods). For the non-linear Burgers equation, we demonstrate numerically that such schemes cause exponential growth of errors. Furthermore, we demonstrate a similar abnormal behaviour for the compressible Euler equations. Finally, we demonstrate numerically that other commonly used split-forms, such as the Kennedy and Gruber splitting, are also locally linearly unstable.},

This equivalence enables the construction of provably entropy stable schemes by a speciﬁc choice of the subcell ﬁnite volume ﬂux. We show that besides the construction of entropy stable high-order schemes, a careful choice of subcell ﬁnite volume ﬂuxes generates split formulations of quadratic or cubic terms. Thus, by changing the subcell ﬁnite volume ﬂux to a speciﬁc choice, we are able to generate, in a systematic way, all common split forms of the compressible Euler advection terms, such as the Ducros splitting and the Kennedy and Gruber splitting. Although these split forms are not entropy stable, we present a systematic way to prove which of those split forms are at least kinetic energy preserving. With this, we construct a uniﬁed high-order split form DG framework. We investigate with three dimensional numerical simulations of the inviscid Taylor–Green vortex and show that the new split forms enhance the robustness of high-order simulations in comparison to the standard scheme when solving turbulent vortex dominated ﬂows. In fact, we show that for certain test cases, the novel split form discontinuous Galerkin schemes are more robust than the discontinuous Galerkin scheme with over-integration.},

As a result, we recover a general form of Brenner’s modiﬁcation of the Navier-Stokes equations. We consider Brenner’s system along with another modiﬁcation where the viscous terms collapse to a Laplacian diﬀusion. For each of the two modiﬁcations, we derive a priori estimates for the PDE, suﬃciently strong to admit a weak solution; we propose a numerical scheme and demonstrate that it satisﬁes the same a priori estimates. For both modiﬁcations, we then demonstrate that the numerical schemes generate solutions that converge to a weak solution (up to a subsequence) as the grid is reﬁned.},

	abstract = {This is an attempt to clarify and size up the many levels possible for the numerical prediction of a turbulent ¯ow, the target being a complete airplane, turbine, or car. Not all the author's opinions will be accepted, but his hope is to stimulate re¯ection, discussion, and planning. These levels still range from a solution of the steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier±Stokes (RANS) equations to a Direct Numerical Simulation, with Large-Eddy Simulation in between. However recent years have added intermediate strategies, dubbed ``VLES'', ``URANS'' and ``DES''. They are in experimental use and, although more expensive, threaten complex RANS models especially for blu-body and similar ¯ows. Turbulence predictions in aerodynamics face two principal challenges: (I) growth and separation of the boundary layer, and (II) momentum transfer after separation. (I) is simpler, but makes very high accuracy demands, and appears to give models of higher complexity little advantage. (II) is now the arena for complex RANS models and the newer strategies, by which time-dependent three-dimensional simulations are the norm even over two-dimensional geometries. In some strategies, grid re®nement is aimed at numerical accuracy; in others it is aimed at richer turbulence physics. In some approaches, the empirical constants play a strong role even when the grid is very ®ne; in others, their role vanishes. For several decades, practical methods will necessarily be RANS, possibly unsteady, or RANS/LES hybrids, pure LES being unaordable. Their empirical content will remain substantial, and the law of the wall will be particularly resistant. Estimates are oered of the grid resolution needed for the application of each strategy to full-blown aerodynamic calculations, feeding into rough estimates of its feasibility date, based on computing-power growth.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13139},
	abstract = {Recently, it was discovered that the entropy-conserving/dissipative high-order split-form discontinuous Galerkin discretizations have robustness issues when trying to solve the simple density wave propagation example for the compressible Euler equations. The issue is related to missing local linear stability, i.e. the stability of the discretization towards perturbations added to a stable base flow. This is strongly related to an anti-diffusion mechanism, that is inherent in entropy-conserving two-point fluxes, which are a key ingredient for the high-order discontinuous Galerkin extension. In this paper, we investigate if pressure equilibrium preservation is a remedy to these recently found local linear stability issues of entropy-conservative/dissipative high-order split-form discontinuous Galerkin methods for the compressible Euler equations. Pressure equilibrium preservation describes the property of a discretization to keep pressure and velocity constant for pure density wave propagation. We present the full theoretical derivation, analysis, and show corresponding numerical results to underline our findings.

In the same way, SBP-SAT ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes can be interpreted as discontinuous Galerkin-type methods with a corresponding weak formulation based on an inner-product formulation common in the ﬁnite element community. This relation allows the use of matrix-vector notation (common in the SBP-SAT ﬁnite diﬀerence community) to show discrete conservation for the split operator formulation of scalar nonlinear conservation laws for DGSEM-GL and diagonal norm SBP-SAT. Based on this result, a skew-symmetric energy stable discretely conservative DGSEM-GL formulation (applicable to general diagonal norm SBP-SAT schemes) for the nonlinear Burgers equation is constructed.},

	abstract = {We analyse instabilities due to aliasing errors when solving one dimensional nonconstant advection speed equations and discuss means to alleviate these types of errors when using high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes. First, we compare analytical bounds for the continuous and discrete version of the PDEs. Whilst traditional L2 norm energy bounds applied to the discrete PDE do not always predict the physical behaviour of the continuous version of the equation, more strict elliptic norm bounds correctly bound the behaviour of the continuous PDE. Having derived consistent bounds, we analyse the effectiveness of two stabilising techniques: over-integration and split form variations (conservative, nonconservative and skew-symmetric). Whilst the former is shown to not alleviate aliasing in general, the latter ensures an aliasing-free solution if the splitting form of the discrete PDE is consistent with the continuous equation. The success of the split form de-aliasing is restricted to DG schemes with the summation-by-parts simultaneous-approximation-term properties (e.g. DG with Gauss–Lobatto points). Numerical experiments are included to illustrate the theoretical ﬁndings.},

The systems under consideration are endowed with an entropy-entropy ﬂux pair. We introduce a general approach to construct second and third order accurate, fully discrete (in both space and time) entropy conservative schemes. In general, these schemes are fully nonlinear implicit, but in some important cases can be explicit or linear implicit. Furthermore, semidiscrete entropy conservative schemes of arbitrary order are presented. The entropy conservative schemes are used to construct a numerical method for the computation of weak solutions containing nonclassical regularization-sensitive shock waves. Finally, speciﬁc examples are investigated and tested numerically.

Ketcheson, {\textbackslash}emph\{Relaxation Runge-Kutta Methods: Conservation and Stability for Inner-Product Norms\}, SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, 2019) is extended to general convex quantities. Conservation, dissipation, or other solution properties with respect to any convex functional are enforced by the addition of a \{{\textbackslash}em relaxation parameter\} that multiplies the Runge-Kutta update at each step. Moreover, other desirable stability (such as strong stability preservation) and efficiency (such as low storage requirements) properties are preserved. The technique can be applied to both explicit and implicit Runge-Kutta methods and requires only a small modification to existing implementations. The computational cost at each step is the solution of one additional scalar algebraic equation for which a good initial guess is available. The effectiveness of this approach is proved analytically and demonstrated in several numerical examples, including applications to high-order entropy-conservative and entropy-stable semi-discretizations on unstructured grids for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.},

In general, this relationship between the entropy variables and the entropy adjoint becomes an approximation when the conservation law is discretized. However, this work shows that the relationship is mimicked discretely for entropy-stable discretizations based on summation-by-parts (SBP) operators and two-point entropy-conservative ﬂux functions; for these discretizations, the discrete entropy variables exactly satisfy the discrete adjoint equation for a particular discretization of the entropybalance functional. A detailed proof of this result is presented for ﬁrst-order conservation laws that are semi-discretized using SBP operators with diagonal norm and boundary operators. Subsequently, generalizations to second-order conservation laws, temporal discretizations, and non-diagonal SBP operators are described. The result is veriﬁed for steady inviscid and viscous ﬂows.},

This new ﬂux function is tested on several one dimensional problems and compared with the original Roe ﬂux. The new ﬂux function exactly preserves the stationary contact discontinuity and does not capture the unphysical rarefaction shock. For steady shock problems, the new ﬂux predicts a slightly more diffused proﬁle whereas for unsteady cases, the captured shock is very similar to those produced by the Roe- ﬂux. The shock stability is also studied in one dimension.

	abstract = {Split form schemes for Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are useful for computation of turbulent ﬂows due to their better robustness. This is because they satisfy additional conservation properties of the governing equations like kinetic energy preservation leading to a reduction in aliasing errors at high orders. Recently, linear stability issues have been pointed out for these schemes for a density wave problem and we investigate this behaviour for some standard split forms. By deriving linearized equations of split form schemes, we show that most existing schemes do not satisfy a perturbation energy equation that holds at the continuous level. A simple modiﬁcation to the energy ﬂux of some existing schemes is shown to yield a scheme that is consistent with the energy perturbation equation. Numerical tests are given using a discontinuous Galerkin method to demonstrate these results.},

Fourier analysis shows that the existing skew-symmetric forms of the convective term result in reduced aliasing errors relative to the conservation form. Several formulations of the convective term, including a new formulation proposed for cubically nonlinear terms, are tested in direct numerical simulation (DNS) of decaying compressible isotropic turbulence both in chemically inert (small density ﬂuctuations) and reactive cases (large density ﬂuctuations) and for diﬀerent degrees of resolution. In the DNS of reactive turbulent ﬂow, the new cubic skew-symmetric form gives the most accurate results, consistent with the spectral error analysis, and at the lowest cost. In marginally resolved DNS and LES (poorly resolved by deﬁnition) the new cubic skew-symmetric form represents a robust convective formulation which minimizes both aliasing and computational cost while also allowing a reduction in the use of computationally expensive high-order dissipative ﬁlters.},

              Centered numerical fluxes can be constructed for compressible Euler equations which preserve kinetic energy in the semi-discrete finite volume scheme. The essential feature is that the momentum flux should be of the form

              consistent approximations to the pressure and the mass flux. This scheme thus leaves most terms in the numerical flux unspecified and various authors have used simple averaging. Here we enforce approximate or exact entropy consistency which leads to a unique choice of all the terms in the numerical fluxes. As a consequence novel entropy conservative flux that also preserves kinetic energy for the semi-discrete finite volume scheme has been proposed. These fluxes are centered and some dissipation has to be added if shocks are present or if the mesh is coarse. We construct scalar artificial dissipation terms which are kinetic energy stable and satisfy approximate/exact entropy condition. Secondly, we use entropy-variable based matrix dissipation flux which leads to kinetic energy and entropy stable schemes. These schemes are shown to be free of entropy violating solutions unlike the original Roe scheme. For hypersonic flows a blended scheme is proposed which gives carbuncle free solutions for blunt body flows. Numerical results for Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the different schemes.},

A convenient implementation of the high-order ﬂuxes is suggested, which guarantees improved computational efﬁciency over existing methods. Numerical tests performed for isotropic turbulence at zero viscosity show stability of schemes with order of accuracy up to ten, and effectiveness of convective splitting of Kennedy and Gruber (2008) [2] in providing extra stability in the presence of strong density variations.

	abstract = {In this work, we discuss the construction of a skew-symmetric discontinuous Galerkin (DG) collocation spectral element approximation for the compressible Euler equations. Starting from the skew-symmetric formulation of Morinishi, we mimic the continuous derivations on a discrete level to ﬁnd a formulation for the conserved variables. In contrast to ﬁnite difference methods, DG formulations naturally have inter-domain surface ﬂux contributions due to the discontinuous nature of the approximation space. Thus, throughout the derivations we accurately track the inﬂuence of the surface ﬂuxes to arrive at a consistent formulation also for the surface terms. The resulting novel skew-symmetric method differs from the standard DG scheme by additional volume terms. Those volume terms have a special structure and basically represent the discretization error of the different product rules. We use the summation-by-parts (SBP) property of the Gauss–Lobattobased DG operator and show that the novel formulation is exactly conservative for the mass, momentum, and energy. Finally, an analysis of the kinetic energy balance of the standard DG discretization shows that because of aliasing errors, a nonzero transport source term in the evolution of the discrete kinetic energy mean value may lead to an inconsistent increase or decrease in contrast to the skew-symmetric formulation. Furthermore, we derive a suitable interface ﬂux that guarantees kinetic energy preservation in combination with the skew-symmetric DG formulation. As all derivations require only the SBP property of the Gauss–Lobatto-based DG collocation spectral element method operator and that the mass matrix is diagonal, all results for the surface terms can be directly applied in the context of multi-domain diagonal norm SBP ﬁnite difference methods. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the theoretical ﬁndings. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

            Summation-by-parts operators can be used in the context of finite difference and discontinuous Galerkin methods to create discretisations mimicking properties given at the continuous level such as entropy conservation. Recently, there has been some interest in schemes for the Euler equations that additionally preserve the kinetic energy. However, some these methods resulted in undesired and unexpected changes of the kinetic energy in numerical experiments of Gassner et al. (J Comput Phys 327:39–66, 2016). Here, analytical insights into kinetic energy preservation are given and new entropy conservative and kinetic energy preserving numerical fluxes are proposed.},

	abstract = {High-order spectral element methods (SEM) for large-eddy simulation (LES) are still very limited in industry. One of the main reasons behind this is the lack of robustness of SEM for under-resolved simulations, which can lead to the failure of the computation or to inaccurate results, aspects that are critical in an industrial setting. To help address this issue, we introduce a nonmodal analysis technique that characterizes the numerical diffusion properties of spectral element methods for linear convection–diffusion problems, including the scales affected by numerical diffusion and the relationship between the amount of numerical diffusion and the level of under-resolution in the simulation. This framework differs from traditional eigenanalysis techniques in that all eigenmodes are taken into account with no need to differentiate them as physical or unphysical. While strictly speaking only valid for linear problems, the non-modal analysis is devised so that it can give critical insights for under-resolved nonlinear problems. For example, why do SEM sometimes suffer from numerical stability issues in LES? And, why do they at other times be robust and successfully predict under-resolved turbulent flows even without a subgrid-scale model? The answer to these questions in turn provides crucial guidelines to construct more robust and accurate schemes for LES.},

The main difﬁculty in developing nonconforming algorithms is the construction of appropriate coupling procedures across nonconforming interfaces. Here, we utilize a computationally simple and efﬁcient approach based upon using decoupled interpolation operators. The resulting scheme is entropy conservative/stable and element-wise conservative. Numerical simulations of the isentropic vortex and viscous shock propagation conﬁrm the entropy conservation/stability and accuracy properties of the method (achieving ∼ p + 1 convergence), which are comparable to those of the original conforming scheme (Carpenter et al. in SIAM J Sci Comput 36(5):B835–B867, 2014; Parsani et al. in SIAM J Sci Comput 38(5):A3129–A3162, 2016). Simulations of the Taylor–Green vortex at Re = 1600 and turbulent ﬂow past a sphere at Re∞ = 2000 show the robustness and stability properties of the overall spatial discretization for unstructured grids. Finally, to demonstrate the entropy conservation property of a fully-discrete explicit entropy stable algorithm with h/ p reﬁnement/coarsening, we present the time evolution of the entropy function obtained by simulating the propagation of the isentropic vortex using a relaxation Runge–Kutta scheme.},

The discretization is dual consistent if it leads to a discrete dual problem that is a consistent approximation of the corresponding continuous dual problem. Consequently, a dual-consistent discretization is a synthesis of the so-called discrete-adjoint and continuous-adjoint approaches. We highlight the impact of dual consistency on summation-byparts (SBP) ﬁnite-diﬀerence discretizations of steady-state PDEs; speciﬁcally, superconvergent functionals and accurate functional error estimates. In the case of functional superconvergence, the discrete-adjoint variables do not need to be computed, since dual consistency on its own is suﬃcent. Numerical examples demonstrate that dual-consistent schemes signiﬁcantly outperform dual-inconsistent schemes in terms of functional accuracy and error-estimate eﬀectiveness. The dual-consistent and dual-inconsisent discretizations have similar computational costs, so dual consistency leads to improved eﬃciency. To illustrate the dual consistency analysis of SBP schemes, we thoroughly examine a discretization of the Euler equations of gas dynamics, including the treatment of the boundary conditions, numerical dissipation, interface penalties, and quadrature by SBP norms.},
